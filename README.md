Get the Code Piece website up and running on your local machine with ease.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

-   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
-   Python (for a quick and easy local server setup) or Node.js (for `http-server`)

### Method 1: Using Python's Built-in HTTP Server (Recommended for simplicity)

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the `code-piece` project:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/code-piece
    ```
3.  Start the Python HTTP server. Choose the command based on your Python version:

    **For Python 3:**
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

    **For Python 2:**
    ```bash
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
    ```
4.  Open your web browser and go to:
    [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Method 2: Using Node.js with `http-server` (If Node.js is installed)

1.  If you haven't already, install the `http-server` package globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/code-piece
    ```
3.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    http-server -p 8000
    ```
4.  Access the website in your browser at:
    [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Method 3: Direct Browser Opening

For the simplest approach, you can open the `index.html` file directly:

1.  Locate the `index.html` file within the `code-piece` directory.
2.  Double-click `index.html`.
3.  Your default web browser will open the website.
